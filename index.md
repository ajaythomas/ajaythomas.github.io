I am Ajay Thomas, a software engineer in the identity and security space. In my spare time, I try to run, read and write, in that order. 

I currently work at [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), an enterprise identity management company, building multi factor authentication. Here, I have worked on server side policy engine, public APIs, identity protocols like SAML and OIDC and framework for native multi factor operations like SMS, email, webauthn etc. Previously, I worked at [WinMagic](https://www.winmagic.com/), a Canadian data security company.
Outside of tech, I also enjoy reading about personal finance, and the economy at large.
