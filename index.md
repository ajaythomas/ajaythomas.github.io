I am Ajay Thomas, a software engineering manager in the identity and security space. In my spare time, I try to run, read and write, in that order. 

I currently work at [dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/) as an engineering manager in the [enterprise product security team](https://www.getdbt.com/security). dbt is the standard for data transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code with best practices like modularity, CI/CD, documentation and governance. 
Before that, I was at [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), an enterprise identity management company, building multi factor authentication. Here, I have worked on server side policy engine, public APIs, identity protocols like SAML and OIDC and framework for native multi factor operations like SMS, email, webauthn etc.

Outside of tech, I also enjoy reading about personal finance, and the economy at large.
